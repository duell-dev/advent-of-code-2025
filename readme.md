Advent of Code 2025
===================

Helping the Elves with Python solutions, one day at a time. I’ll drop links to the official puzzles here so you can read the story and compare answers.

Days
----
- Day 1: https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1
- Day 2: https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2
- Day 3+: coming soon (check back after each starry night)

How to run
----------
From the repo root:
```
python3 aoc2025/<day>/aoc<day>.py
```
Replace `<day>` with the number (e.g., `1` or `2`).

There multiple options for input files. 
So feel free to plug your own content into the `input` file and watch the magic happen!
